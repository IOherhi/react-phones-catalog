# Phone Catalog App

# [Demo](https://IOherhi.github.io/react-phones-catalog)

This is a React app built using modern technologies and interface development approaches.

## Technologies

- **HTML5** â€” modern semantic markup
- **SCSS Modules** â€” scoped and modular styling
- **React** + **TypeScript (TSX)** â€” component-based architecture with strict typing
- **React Router** â€” client-side routing
- **Vite** â€” fast bundler and dev server
- **IntersectionObserver API** â€” tracking elements in the viewport (used for lazy loading, active states, etc.)
- **SwiperJS** â€” basic usage of sliders/carousels
- **Fetch API** â€” asynchronous HTTP requests to the server
- **localStorage** â€” persistent storage for user state (e.g., cart, favorites)
- **Responsive Design** â€” adaptability for different screen sizes
- **Git + GitHub** â€” version control and deployment

## Main Project Structure

- **Home page**: presentation page with a slider and popular products.

  - Includes filtering
  - Supports pagination (4 / 8 / 16 items per page)
